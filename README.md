# TODoList app built with EJS, Node.js, databases 

this is the same ToDoList app as before. but I upgrade to a version that  has MongoDB database on the backend. It will show you the current date and month at the top and you can get to check off your to do list items. and you can create custom list just add the list name to the end of the route(URL). And you also get to addd new items which will get added to your To Do list.

note: Starting November 28th, 2022, free Heroku Dynos, free Heroku Postgres, and free Heroku Data for RedisÂ® will no longer be available. so I record the video  in case the link does not work : https://youtu.be/PyuxPcZuBr8




How to develop this web app 
1. use EJS templates as the frontend to pass data between the server and EJS files. 
2. use Node.js and express.js as the backend. 
3. create custom list using Express Route Parameters.
4. using MongoDB and Mongoose framework to save users data to a MongoDB database. 
5. deploy the webapp with a database to Heroku.
